My name is Kyle Spaulding. I've worked in graphics design since 2001 and have a passion for creative problem solving and brand elevation. My primary focuses are branding, web design, and front end development. I work with a small team of skilled platform developers as needed. 

I currently live in the Sierra Foothills where I enjoy balancing my time between working in my office in downtown Nevada City, working on my 15 acre property, and spending time with my family... preferably playing outdoors.

If you are interested in hiring me for a project, please [contact me](/contact) and we can chat. I'm currently taking on small to medium sized projects, or even a full time gig if it's a good fit.
